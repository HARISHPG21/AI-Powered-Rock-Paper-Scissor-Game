# AI-Powered-Rock-Paper-Scissor-Game

Rock-Paper-Scissors is a universally recognized hand game that has long been used for
fun and decision-making. This project aims to elevate this simple game by integrating artificial
intelligence and game theory principles with a visually appealing Python-based GUI. The system
is designed to allow users to play against a smart AI opponent or another human player in
multiplayer mode. The AI learns from the userâ€™s past moves to predict future ones, adapting its
strategy using varying difficulty levels. The game includes an intuitive graphical user interface
built with Tkinter, featuring theme switching, animated outcomes, emoji-based visuals, and
score tracking. The project emphasizes both entertainment and education, helping users
understand how AI adapts and learns, even in basic games. This report outlines the motivation,
system design, core algorithm, implementation, testing, and practical use cases for this
interactive game.
